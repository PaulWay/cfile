Things to do to cfile:

bug fixes:
* close file in _open if struct alloc fails.

improvements:
* cfsize returns 0 on a file being written?  Or keep a track of how
  many bytes we've written and return that.
* cfile can also provide cfgetc
* providing cfungetc seems pointless though - who uses ungetc?
